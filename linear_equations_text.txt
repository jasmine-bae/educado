A linear equation is an equation for a straight line
These are all linear equations:
yes 	  	y = 2x + 1
yes 	  	5x = 6 + 3y
yes 	  	y/2 = 3 − x

Let us look more closely at one example:
Example: y = 2x + 1 is a linear equation:

line on a graph

The graph of y = 2x+1 is a straight line

 

    When x increases, y increases twice as fast, so we need 2x
    When x is 0, y is already 1. So +1 is also needed
    And so: y = 2x + 1

Here are some example values:
x 	y = 2x + 1
-1 	y = 2 × (-1) + 1 = -1
0 	y = 2 × 0 + 1 = 1
1 	y = 2 × 1 + 1 = 3
2 	y = 2 × 2 + 1 = 5

Check for yourself that those points are part of the line above!
