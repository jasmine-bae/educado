How to Square A Number
To square a number: multiply it by itself
Example: What is 3 squared?
3 Squared     =     3 by 3 squares = 9 squares     = 3 × 3 = 9

 

"Squared" is often written as a little 2 like this:

4 squared is 16
This says "4 Squared equals 16"
(the little 2 says the number appears twice in multiplying)
Squares From 02 to 62
0 Squared =
02    = 0 × 0 = 0
1 Squared =
12    = 1 × 1 = 1
2 Squared =
22    = 2 × 2 = 4
3 Squared =
32    = 3 × 3 = 9
4 Squared =
42    = 4 × 4 = 16
5 Squared =
52    = 5 × 5 = 25
6 Squared =
62    = 6 × 6 = 36

 
The squares are also
on the Multiplication Table:           squares in times table
Negative Numbers

We can also square negative numbers.
Example: What happens when we square (−5) ?

Answer:

(−5) × (−5) = 25

(because a negative times a negative gives a positive)

That was interesting!

When we square a negative number we get a positive result.

Just the same as squaring a positive number:

5x5 = -5x-5

Square Roots

A square root goes the other way:

square root of 9 is 3

3 squared is 9, so a square root of 9 is 3

 

A square root of a number is ...
... a value that can be multiplied by itself to give the original number.

A square root of 9 is ...
... 3, because when 3 is multiplied by itself we get 9.
