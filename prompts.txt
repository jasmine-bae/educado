You are an assistant that will be generating text content for an explorable explanation of a research paper that will be prompted. keep the explanations down to a 6-10 minute read. The prompt will include the level of reader's knowledge of the topic, the research paper text, and any other information related to the topic.

As you generate the blog text, suggest areas where a mathematical animation, some image, or other diagrams/links to content should be inserted in the blog post. Use "//manim" on a new line for math animation, "//image {content src or description}" for images, "//video_link {content src or description} for videos",  "//link {hyperlink/description}" for links, and "//other {description}" for any other ideas that can be helpful. 

Use the following blog post as a toolset for how you should be creating the summarization/explanation: """
You want to share a powerful idea ‚Äì an idea that could really enrich the lives of whoever you gift it to! But communication is hard. So how do you share an idea, in such a way that makes sure the message is received?

Well, that's easy. Do it like this:

Nah, I'm kidding. The actual process is a lot more painful.

In this post, I'm going to share how I make explorable explanations: interactive things that help you learn by playing! Although my creative process involves a lot of backtracking and wrong turns and general flailing about, I have found a nice "pattern" for teaching things. There are no plug-and-chug formulas, but hopefully this post can help you help others learn something new ‚Äì whether that's through reading, through watching, or through playing.

And the first thing to do is start with...

bottom of hill

Start With ü§î?
‚ÄúWhat makes [traditional teaching] so ineffective is that it answers questions the student hasn‚Äôt thought to ask. [...] You have to help them love the questions.‚Äù

~ Steven Strogatz, "Writing about Math for the Perplexed & the Traumatized"

Practicing what I preach: this very blog post starts with an important question that everyone cares about ‚Äì "how do you share an idea?"

But you don't have to make the question so blatantly in-your-face. In The Evolution of Trust, I posed the question in the form of a story: why & how did WWI soldiers create peace in the trenches? And in Parable of the Polygons, I posed the question in the form of a game: why & how does a small individual bias result in large collective segregation?

However you choose to do it, you've got to make your reader / viewer / player curious ‚Äì you've got to make them love your question.

Only then, will they be motivated to make the long, hard climb up the...

walk up hill

Up The Ladder of Abstraction
Yeah I'm mixing my metaphors a bit here with hills and ladders but WHATEVER, the point is you've got to start grounded, then move your way up, step by step, slowly.

You may think that's obvious. But, seeing how many lecturers spew abstract jargon ‚Äì talking in the clouds while their audience is still on the ground ‚Äì yeah, no. Apparently it's not obvious. (Alternatively, some people try to "dumb it down" for the public. But the goal shouldn't be to dumb the ideas down, it should be to smart the people up.)

So: start on the ground. The very first thing you should do is give the reader a concrete experience. In Parable of the Polygons, you start by directly dragging & dropping a neighborhood of shapes. In The Evolution of Trust, you start by directly playing against a bunch of opponents. The trick is to pick an experience that will be a good foundation for everything else you'll be building on top of it.

Then, move up, step by step. I think a good logical argument is like a good story: it shouldn't be "one damn thing after another". Matt Stone & Trey Parker once said that instead of making stories like this: "this happens, and then that happens, and then that happens, etc"... you should make stories like this: "this happens, THEREFORE that happens, BUT that happens, THEREFORE this happens, etc".
(sidenote: (for more on this idea, watch Tony Zhou's brilliant video essay on structuring video essays))

The same is true of any good explanation. In The Evolution of Trust, I tried to connect as many points as I could with BUT: "You can both win if you both cooperate BUT in a single game you'll both cheat BUT in a repeated game cooperation can succeed BUT in this scenario cheaters take over in the short term BUT in the long term the cooperators succeed again BUT..." and so on, and so on.

I like these big BUTs, and I cannot lie: it means I can show off a new counter-intuitive idea every few minutes! That's a story that's packed with plot twists.
(sidenote: (note: you may also sometimes want to step back down from the abstract to the concrete. check out Bret Victor's Up & Down The Ladder of Abstraction, which has inspired, like, 90% of my work.))

Anyway, once you've helped your reader reach the top of the hill / ladder / whatever metaphor we're using here, it's best to end with...

look out

End With ü§î?
You want to share a powerful idea ‚Äì why's it powerful? How does your idea let people see further?

At the end of most of my explorables, I have a "Sandbox Mode". There's a sandbox at the end of Polygons, Trust, Ballot, Fireflies, Emoji Simulator... yeah to be honest, it's a bit of a clich√© for me at this point, but here's the reason why I have those sandboxes:

In the beginning, I start by giving the player my question. And at the end, I want them to explore their own questions.

Once you've helped someone get to the top of a hill, your student can now see not just other hills that they didn't see before, but other hills that even you didn't see before. That's the true value of ending on an open-ended question: it allows the student to go beyond the teacher.

. . .

I feel like I've finally made it to the top of a tiny hill. I made my first explorable explanation 3¬Ω years ago: a tutorial on making a cool visual effect for 2D games. And I've learnt a heck of a lot since then!

But the more I learn, the more I realize how much I've yet to learn. There's so much I want to try out. Heck, here's a list:

Explorables that aren't just single-player
Explorables that use real-world data
Explorables where you actually solve problems, not just puzzles
Explorables that don't follow a set linear story: it can change its lesson based on the reader's interests & prior knowledge.
Explorables that are partially user-generated
Explorables that allow dialogue between peer learners
Explorables that aren't standalone experiences, but something you can come back to again and again over time.
Explorables in VR, or AR, or just... R.
Explorables where you can actually make your own projects... such as making an explorable!
Trying out all of that seems pretty daunting, but 1) "How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time." And 2) a lot of other people are also interested in making explorables! It's impossible for any one person to climb all these hills, but collectively, we can explore this wild, weird terrain ‚Äì and together, we can bite a lot of elephants! okay my metaphors are getting really mixed here

But the point is this: TRUE learning is a never-ending process. You start with a ü§î, you end with more ü§î. Like Sisyphus, every time we get to the top of a hill, we'll just have to go back down, to perform the climb again.

And I wouldn't have it any other way.
Explorable Explanations. Interactive non-fiction. Active essays. Glogs.

We never came up with a name for what we're doing, but at least we know we're not going to use "glogs", which is like blogs and vlogs, except it's glogs.

This weekend, I attended a small 20-person workshop on figuring out how to use interactivity to help teach concepts. I don't mean glorified flash cards or clicking through a slideshow. I mean stuff like my 2D lighting tutorial, or this geology-simulation textbook, or this explorable explanation on explorable explanations.

Over the course of the weekend workshop, we collected a bunch of design patterns and considerations, which I've made crappy diagrams of, as seen below. Note: this was originally written for members of the workshop, so there's a lot of external references that you might not get if you weren't there.

"Do and Show and Tell"

Do & Show & Tell
Don't try to explain everything with something interactive. Use interactivity only when interactivity works best, otherwise, supplement it with text & images. Also keep in mind the overlaps of Do & Show & Tell: when text interacts with the diagrams (e.g. Tangle), and vice versa.

Text: Best at describing very abstract concepts.
Graphs: Best at showing broad relationships at a glance.
Animations: Best at showing temporal relationships.
Interactives: Best at showing processes, systems, models. (See final slide on Procedural Rhetoric)

"Interest Curve"

Interest Curves
Start with a hook: The hook provides an overview, motivates the explorer, but doesn't require a lot of upfront knowledge. Example: Mathigon's Chocolate Box intro in the Game Theory post is very interactive, but it requires no upfront knowledge of game theory. (In fact, if you already knew about game theory, you'd know you'd always lose the Chocolate Box game.)

Build up from basics: (more on the next slide)

How to conclude: This ending should make use of the knowledge the explorer's learnt throughout the explanation. Something they wouldn't have been able to fully appreciate before they had learned the prior things. Example: Earth, A Primer ends with a sandbox you can only fully understand once you learnt about the full ecosystem.

"Start Small, Build Big"

Start small, build big.
An Explorable Explanation usually works best to explain a system, a model, a network of cause-and-effect. Such systems can often be broken up into smaller mechanics, which you should teach in isolation first before combining them. This is the "building-up" phase of the Interest Curve.

Example: Miegakure

A: Teach "jumping" in isolation
B: Teach "walking in 4D" in isolation
A+B: A level that needs you to jump across blocks in 4D.
C: Teach "pushing blocks" in isolation
A+C: A level that needs you to push a block, so you can jump to the exit.
B+C: A level that needs you to push a block in 4D.
A+B+C: A level that needs you to push a block in 4D, and use it to jump in 4D to the exit.
"A quick note on playtesting"

A quick note on playtesting.
Remember to test your explanation with people! For example, Earth A Primer benefited from this a lot. After seeing a lot of explorers simply skim through content, and get confused because they skipped stuff they didn't know, content gating was added. And paradoxically, by withholding some content, the explorer learned more.

"See, Model, Apply"

See, Model, Apply
1. Let the explorer create their own data points, and form their own model.

In Angry Physics, the explorer literally creates their own data points on a 2D graph of firing angle vs landing position. And with enough data points, they realize there's a sine-wave-like pattern. It doesn't have to be literally data points -- in Mathigon's Game Theory example, it gives the explorer a "game", that if they play enough times, they realize they will never win if they go first.

2. Embedding "homework problems" into the explorable explanation itself.

The "homework problems" can range from explicit to implicit. (also related to the next slide on Cognitive Gates) On the more explicit side, Earth A Primer doesn't let an explorer progress unless they fulfil the task given to them. On the more implicit side, Angry Physics gives the explorer optional targets to shoot, which they'll be better at once they've created their sine-wave model.

"Cognitive Gates"

Cognitive Gates
We should also consider how much "gating" we should do for our content. Paradoxically, by withholding an explanation, the explorable explanation can be more effective. It gets the explorer more motivated to seek it out for themselves. As someone said, we shouldn't discount the value of "mucking about" in learning.

In other media, there already is "gating" of some sort. You can't simply learn calculus without knowing algebra. You can't simply skip to Act III of a film and appreciate the drama without knowing the characters and prior setup. In Explorable Explanations/GLOGS, we should also have "gating", whether explicit/implicit, to make sure the explorer doesn't accidentally stumble across a part they don't have the prior knowledge yet to fully understand.

"A quick note on gamification"

A quick note on gamification.
Gamification is about changing behaviour. We're about changing knowledge.
(besides, "gamification" is kind of a dirty word nowadays)

That said, it is worth discussing how games motivate the behaviour of going out of your way to learn something. There is a model of 4 Player Types, of four main motivations of why people play games. (and remember, these are spectrums, and everyone is a little bit of all of these.)

Achievers: These people love overcoming problems given to them. Think Project Euler. We can appeal to this motive with "embedded homework problems" and content gating, as described in the last two slides.
Explorers: These people love digging around in a sandbox, and creating new things. Think "exploration mode" in Minecraft. This is the motive that all our Explorable Explanations appeal to, I mean, it's in the name!
Socializers: These people love building relationships with others. Think of the sharing/remixing features of Scratch. Letting explorers share their solutions/creations could appeal to this motive.
Killers: (this is a terrible name) These people love competition. Think of... well, any competition. If you have sharing in your Explorable Explanation, you could appeal to this motive by hosting contests for shared entries.
"Author-guided & Player-driven"

Author-guided & Player-driven
An actor can act a play however they want, but the playwright still guides the outline. A sailboat can sail anywhere, but still follows the wind and the river. An explorer can play with an explanation however they like, but we, as authors, can still guide them.

How? Well, next slide...

"Procedural Rhetoric"

Procedural Rhetoric
Ian Bogost coined the term "procedural rhetoric", to describe the kind of rhetoric a game/interactive system has a comparative advantage over other media.

Illustrators have ways of using shapes and perspective to guide the eye. Filmmakers use motion and camerawork to guide a viewer. We can guide an explorer with explicit/implict goals, acting out an algorithm, or merely the option to do something.
